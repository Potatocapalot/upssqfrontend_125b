    <h2>Server-Side vs Client-Side code</h2> 
    <p>
        When you hear the term <em>server-side</em> and <em>client-side</em> code especially in the term of web development, client side code is code that runs on the user's computer. 
        <span>-A web page is viewed, the page's client side code is downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser. In this module, we are explicitly talking about client-side java script.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Server side code on the other runs on the server. Then its result are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of popular server side web languagues includes; php, phyton, ruby, c and even javascript. Java script can also be used as a server side language. For example, in the popular node.js environment

    <h3>Dynamic vs Static code</h3>
    <p>
        The word <strong>dynamic</strong>is used to describe both <i>client side</i> javascript and <i>server side</i> languagues.
        <span>
            -It refers to the ability to update the display of the webpage/app to show different things in differnet circumstances, generating new content as required.
        </span>
        Server side code dynamically generates new content on the server. For example, pulling data from a data base, whereas client javascript dynamically generates new content inside the broswer on the client. For example, creating a new html with table data requested by the user, then displaying the table in a webpage shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in two context but related and both approaches (server-side and client-side) ususally work together
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as <strong>static</strong>
        <span>
            -It shows the same content all the time
        </span>
    </p>
