            <h2>The src Attribute</h2>
            <p>The 
                <span>
                    <
                </span>
                <span>
                    img
                </span>
                <span>
                    >
                </span>
                tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
                <br>
                <img src="c:\Users\HP\OneDrive\Documents\WhatsApp Image 2025-06-19 at 03.48.03_e91a8937.jpg" width="250" height="00"> 
             </p>
                There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example:
                        src="the picture link..."
                        <br>
                        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be violation of copyright laws.
                        <br>
                        In addition, you cannoot control external images: it can suddenly be removed or changed.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Relative URL - links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="image". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="image".</li>
                    <br>
                    Tip: It is almost alwaysbest to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change the domain
                </ul>
                <hr>
                
                <h2>The width and height Attributes</h2>
                <p>The <span>
                    <
                </span>
                   img
                   <span>
                    >
                   </span> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels)
                   <br>
                   <h4>Example</h4>
                   imagine in a picture here
                   </p>
                   <hr>
                   <h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
                   <p>The required alt attribute for the <span>
                    <
                   </span>
                img
                <span>
                    >
                </span> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.
                <h4>Example</h4>
                imagine a picture here...
                <h4>Example</h4>
                imagine a picture her...

                <h2>The style Atrribute</h2>
                <p>
                    The syle attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
                    <h4>Example</h4>

                <h2>The Lang Attribute</h2>
                <p>
                    You should always include the lanh=g attribute inside the <span>
                        <
                    </span>
                    html
                    <span>
                        >
                    </span> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search egines and browsers.
                    <br>
                    The followung example specifies English as the language
                    <h5>imagine a picture here...</h5>
                    <br>
                    Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last to characters define the country.
                    <br>
                    The following example specifies English as the language and United States asthe country:
                    <h5>imagine a picture here...</h5>
                    <br>
                    You can see all the language codes in our HTML Language Code Reference.

                <h2>The title Attribute</h2>
                <p>
                    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
                    <br>
                    The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    imagine a picture here
                    </p>
                    <h2>We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes</h2>
                    The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
                    <br>
                    The title attribute (and all ither attributes) can be writeen wuth uppercase or lowercase ike title or TITLE.
                    <br>
                    However, W3C recommends lower case attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attrubutes for stricter document types like XHTML.
                    <br>
                    At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names.

                </p>
                <p>
                <h2>We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values</h2>
                The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.
                <br>
                However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.
                <h4>Good:</h4>
                imagine a picture here...
                <br>
                <h4>Bad</h4>
                imagine a picture here...
                <br>
                Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:
                <h4>Example</h4>
                imagine a picure here...
                <br>
                At W3Schools we always use quotes around attribute values.
                </p>

                <br>
                <h2>Single or Double Quotes?</h2>
                <p>
                    Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
                    <br>
                    In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessart to use single quotes:
                    <h5>imagine a picture here...</h5>
                    or vice versa:
                    <br>
                    <h5>imagine a picture here</h5>
