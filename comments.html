    <h2>HTML Comments</h2>
    <p>
        HTML comments are not displayed in the browswer, but they can help documnet your HTML source code.

    <h3>HTML Comment Tag</h3>
    <p>
        You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
        <br>
        Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the tag.
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Add Comments</h3>
    <p>
        With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:
        <br>
        <h4>Example</h4>
         </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h3>Hide content</h3>
        <p>
            Comments can be used to hide content.
            <br>
            This can be helpful if you hide content temporarily:
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <br>
            You can also hide more than one line. Everything between the <span>
                <
            </span>!
            <span>
                >
            </span>-- and the --
            <span>
                >
            </span> will be hidden from the display.
            <br>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <br>
            Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code one at a time, to search for errors.
        </p>

        <h3>Hide Inline Content</h3>
        <p>
            Comments can be used to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code:
            <h4>Example</h4>
        </p>
